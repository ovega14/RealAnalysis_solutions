\section*{Problem 1}
\begin{proof}
	We have that $\forall x \in \R$, $|\arctan(x)| < \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
		\arctan(x) \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right),
	\end{equation}
	which is an open set. So $\forall |y| < \frac{\pi}{2}$, $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such that $(y - \epsilon, y + \epsilon) \subset (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$. Thus for every such $y$, we can always find a $y_0 < y$ and $y_1 > y$ inside this open set. This means that there is no $x_1$ such that $\arctan(x_1) \geq \arctan(x)$ nor an $x_0$ such that $\arctan(x_0) \leq \arctan(x)$ $\forall x$.
	
	Hence $f(x) = \arctan(x)$ does not achieve an absolute minimum or maximum.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 2}
\begin{proof}
	Let $x, y \in (c, \infty)$. Choose $L = \frac{1}{c^2}$. Then
	\begin{align}
		|f(y) - f(x)| &= \Big|\frac{1}{y} - \frac{1}{x}\Big| \\
		&= \frac{|x - y|}{xy} \\
		&< \frac{|x - y|}{c^2} \\
		&= L |x - y|.
	\end{align}
	Therefore $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is Lipschitz continuous.
\end{proof}

\section*{Problem 3}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\delta > 0$ and choose $\epsilon_0 = |\sin(\delta)|$. Choose $x = \frac{1}{2\pi k + \delta}$ and $c = \frac{1}{2 \pi k}$ for some $k \in \N$. Then
	\begin{align}
		|x - c| &= \Big|\frac{1}{2 \pi k} - \frac{1}{2 \pi k}\Big| \\
		&= \Big|\frac{2 \pi k - (2 \pi k + \delta)}{2 \pi k (2 \pi k + \delta)}\Big| \\
		&= \frac{\delta}{4 \pi^2 k^2 + 2 \pi k \delta} \\
		&< \delta.
	\end{align}
	We also have
	\begin{align}
		|f(x) - f(c)| &= |\sin(2 \pi k + \delta) - \sin(2 \pi k)| \\
		&= |\sin(2 \pi k)\cos(\delta) + \cos(2 \pi k)\sin(\delta) - \sin(2 \pi k)| \\
		&= |\sin(\delta)| \\
		&= \epsilon_0.
	\end{align}
	Hence, $f(x) = \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ is not uniformly continuous.
\end{proof}
